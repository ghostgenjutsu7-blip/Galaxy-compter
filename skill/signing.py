"""skill/signing.py — SHA-256 skill signing + re-verification.

§10, §18, §25 Phase 10 53. At ingest, Galaxy computes a SHA-256 of each
skill's normalized content. For trusted sources, the hash is stored and
re-verified weekly by the Subconscious Loop (protects against the upstream
repo silently changing after Galaxy already vetted it). For community skills,
a hash mismatch on re-fetch quarantines the skill and notifies the user
rather than silently accepting changed code.
